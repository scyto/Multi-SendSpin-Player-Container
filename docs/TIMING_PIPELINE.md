# MultiRoomAudio Timing Pipeline

This document explains how MultiRoomAudio handles each step of the timing adjustments for synchronized multi-room audio playback.

## The Timing Challenge

Audio comes from Music Assistant **timestamped** - each audio chunk has a specific time it should be played. We have an **unknown amount of latency** that our software + hardware stack introduces:

```
+----------------------+
|   Music Assistant    |
|   Server Clock       |----------------------+
+----------------------+                      |
         |                                    | Clock Sync
         | "Play this audio at               | (NTP-like)
         |  timestamp T=12345.678s"          |
         |                                    |
         v                                    v
+------------------------------------------------------+
|                 MultiRoomAudio                        |
|                                                       |
|  +-------------+    +--------------+    +---------+  |
|  | Network     |--->| SDK Buffer   |--->| Pulse   |  |
|  | Buffer      |    | + Sync Adj   |    | Audio   |  |
|  | (latency 1) |    | (latency 2)  |    | (lat 3) |  |
|  +-------------+    +--------------+    +---------+  |
|                                                       |
|  Total latency = lat1 + lat2 + lat3 + ???            |
+------------------------------------------------------+
         |
         v
    +---------+
    | Speaker |  <- Audio plays at actual time T'
    +---------+

    If T' != T, we're out of sync!
```

## Step 1: Clock Synchronization

**Purpose**: Establish a shared time reference between server and client.

### How It Works

The SDK's `KalmanClockSynchronizer` implements an NTP-like protocol:

1. **Ping-Pong Measurement**:
   ```
   Client sends ping at local time T1
   Server receives at server time T2
   Server sends pong at server time T3
   Client receives at local time T4

   Round-trip time = (T4 - T1) - (T3 - T2)
   Clock offset ~ ((T2 - T1) + (T3 - T4)) / 2
   ```

2. **Kalman Filter**: Refines offset estimate over multiple measurements
3. **Drift Estimation**: Tracks how fast our clock diverges from server's

### Our Configuration

```csharp
var clockSync = new KalmanClockSynchronizer(logger);
```

### Key Metrics (from Stats for Nerds)

| Metric | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| `ClockOffsetMs` | Our clock vs server (can be huge, just needs to be stable) |
| `UncertaintyMs` | Confidence interval (lower = more precise) |
| `DriftRatePpm` | Parts-per-million clock drift (typical: 1-50 ppm) |
| `IsDriftReliable` | True after enough measurements for stable drift estimate |
| `MeasurementCount` | Number of sync measurements taken |

### What "Converged" Means

The SDK considers sync "minimal" after just 2 measurements (`HasMinimalSync`), enabling fast startup. Full convergence takes more measurements for lower uncertainty.

---

## Step 2: Audio Buffering with Timestamps

**Purpose**: Hold audio until it's time to play, handle jitter.

### How It Works

The SDK's `TimedAudioBuffer` receives audio chunks with timestamps:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|               TimedAudioBuffer                         |
|                                                        |
|  Capacity: 8000ms    Target: 250ms                    |
|                                                        |
|  +---------------------------------------------+      |
|  | T=100ms | T=110ms | T=120ms | ... | T=350ms |      |
|  +---------------------------------------------+      |
|           ^                               ^           |
|           |                               |           |
|        Read pointer              Write pointer        |
|        (current playback)        (incoming audio)     |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Buffer Behavior

1. **On Write**: Audio chunks are added with their server timestamps
2. **On Read**: Buffer checks current synchronized time
   - If read timestamp < current time: **We're behind** -> speed up
   - If read timestamp > current time: **We're ahead** -> slow down or wait

### Sendspin Protocol Specifics

- Server can send audio up to **5 seconds ahead**
- Our "Target" (250ms) is really a **minimum buffer** for smooth playback
- Buffer levels of 4000-5000ms are normal during stable playback

### Our Configuration

```csharp
bufferCapacityMs: 8000,  // Maximum buffer size
syncOptions: PulseAudioSyncOptions  // Custom sync tuning
buffer.TargetBufferMilliseconds = 250;  // Faster startup
```

---

## Step 3: Sync Error Detection

**Purpose**: Determine how far off our playback timing is.

### How Sync Error Is Calculated

```
Sync Error = Wall Clock Elapsed Time - Samples Consumed Time

Where:
- Wall Clock Elapsed = Current sync time - Playback start time
- Samples Consumed Time = Total samples read / Sample rate
```

**Example**:
```
Started playing at T=0
After 10 seconds (wall clock):
- If we've read 480,000 samples at 48kHz = 10.0 seconds of audio
- Sync error = 10.0s - 10.0s = 0ms (good)

- If we've read 479,040 samples = 9.98 seconds of audio
- Sync error = 10.0s - 9.98s = +20ms (we're behind, playing old audio)

- If we've read 480,960 samples = 10.02 seconds of audio
- Sync error = 10.0s - 10.02s = -20ms (we're ahead, playing too fast)
```

### Important Note on Output Latency

**Output latency is NOT used in sync error calculation!**

The `OutputLatencyMs` we report (from PulseAudio) is used for:
- Diagnostics in Stats for Nerds
- Knowing when audio will actually reach the speaker

But the SDK calculates sync error purely from sample counts vs wall clock time.

---

## Step 4: Sync Correction

**Purpose**: Correct timing errors when detected.

`BufferedAudioSampleSource` reads raw samples from the SDK buffer and applies sync correction via frame drop/insert with interpolation.

### Deadband (No Correction)

If sync error is within ±5ms, no correction is applied:
```csharp
CorrectionThresholdMicroseconds = 5_000,  // 5ms deadband
```

Small errors are ignored because human ears can't perceive timing differences under 5ms, and constant micro-corrections would cause more artifacts than they fix.

### Frame Drop/Insert (Active Correction)

When sync error exceeds the deadband, `BufferedAudioSampleSource` applies frame-level corrections:

**Frame DROP** (when behind schedule - positive sync error):
- Consumes 2 input frames, outputs 1 interpolated frame
- Uses **3-point weighted interpolation** when 3+ frames available: `0.25*A + 0.5*B + 0.25*C`
- Falls back to **2-point linear** at buffer edge: `(A + B) / 2`

**Frame INSERT** (when ahead of schedule - negative sync error):
- Outputs 1 interpolated frame without consuming input
- Uses **true lookahead**: `(current + next) / 2` when 2+ frames available
- Falls back to `(lastOutput + current) / 2` at buffer edge

### Correction Rate

The frequency of corrections scales with error magnitude:
```csharp
// Formula: interval = 500_000 / absErrorMicroseconds
// 10ms error → correct every 50 frames
// 50ms error → correct every 10 frames (more aggressive)
// Clamped to range [10, 500] frames
```

### Why Interpolation?

Abruptly dropping or duplicating a frame causes audible clicks. The 3-point weighted interpolation uses a Gaussian-like kernel that considers the frame after the drop point, producing smoother blends than simple averaging.

---

## Step 5: Audio Output

**Purpose**: Send audio to the sound card via PulseAudio.

### Direct Passthrough Architecture

The audio path is simple - no application-level resampling:

```
TimedAudioBuffer --> BufferedAudioSampleSource --> PulseAudioPlayer --> PulseAudio
     (SDK)                (Bridge)                   (Output)           (Server)
```

PulseAudio handles all format conversion:
- Sample rate conversion (e.g., 48kHz -> 192kHz)
- Bit depth conversion (e.g., float -> S24_LE)
- Device format negotiation

### Our Push-Based Model

```csharp
private void PlaybackLoop()
{
    while (_isPlaying)
    {
        // 1. Read from buffer source (sync-adjusted samples)
        var samplesRead = source.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);

        // 2. Apply volume
        for (int i = 0; i < samplesRead; i++)
            buffer[i] *= volume;

        // 3. Convert to output format (float -> S32_LE/S24_LE/S16_LE)
        BitDepthConverter.Convert(floatBuffer, byteBuffer, bitDepth);

        // 4. Write to PulseAudio (BLOCKING)
        SimpleWrite(paHandle, ptr, bytes);
    }
}
```

### Latency Reporting

We query PulseAudio latency:
```csharp
var latencyUs = SimpleGetLatency(paHandle, out error);
OutputLatencyMs = (int)(latencyUs / 1000);
```

---

## Step 6: Delay Offset (User Fine-Tuning)

**Purpose**: Allow manual adjustment for speaker placement, etc.

### How It Works

```csharp
// Set static delay offset
clockSync.StaticDelayMs = -50;  // Play 50ms earlier
```

This shifts the effective playback schedule:
- Positive values: Delay playback (play later)
- Negative values: Advance playback (play earlier)

### Use Cases

- Speaker closer to listener -> negative delay
- Speaker farther from listener -> positive delay
- Compensate for DSP processing in DAC/receiver

## Key Metrics to Monitor (Stats for Nerds)

| Section | Metric | Healthy Value | Concern |
|---------|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Sync Status** | Sync Error | +/-5ms (green) | >20ms (red) |
| **Sync Status** | Playback Rate | 0.98-1.02 | Stuck at 0.96 or 1.04 |
| **Buffer** | Buffered | 2000-5000ms | <100ms or growing unbounded |
| **Buffer** | Underruns | 0 | Any value > 0 |
| **Clock Sync** | Uncertainty | <1ms | >5ms |
| **Clock Sync** | Drift Rate | <50 ppm | >100 ppm |
| **Throughput** | Dropped (sync) | 0 | Large numbers |

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Constant Sync Error (e.g., -200ms)

**Symptom**: Sync error never reaches zero, playback rate stuck at extreme.

**Likely Causes**:
1. PulseAudio latency mismatch
2. Push vs pull timing model difference
3. Buffer state at playback start

**Investigation**: Check if error is stable. A stable error might indicate a systematic offset in our timing model.

### Growing Buffer with Stable Error

**Symptom**: Buffer grows to 4000-5000ms, error stays constant.

**Explanation**: This is actually NORMAL. The server sends audio ahead, and we buffer it. The Sendspin protocol allows up to 5 seconds of look-ahead.

### Audio Clicks or Pops

**Symptom**: Intermittent clicks during playback.

**Possible Causes**:
1. Buffer underrun
2. PulseAudio configuration issues
3. USB device issues

**Fix**: Check logs for underrun messages, verify PulseAudio is running correctly.
