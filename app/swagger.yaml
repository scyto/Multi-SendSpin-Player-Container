  title: Multi-Room Audio Controller API
  description: |
    A comprehensive API for managing multiple audio players in a multi-room setup.
    Supports Squeezelite (LMS/SlimProto), Sendspin (Music Assistant native), and Snapcast players.

    ## Features
    - **Multi-room audio control** - Manage multiple audio players
    - **Multiple backends** - Squeezelite (LMS), Sendspin (Music Assistant), Snapcast
    - **Volume control** - Hardware ALSA mixer integration
    - **Device management** - Auto-detect and configure audio devices
    - **Real-time updates** - WebSocket support for live status updates
    - **Debug tools** - Audio device detection and troubleshooting
    - **HAOS Support** - Runs as Home Assistant OS add-on with PulseAudio

    ## Player Types
    - **Squeezelite**: Traditional LMS/SlimProto player for Logitech Media Server
    - **Sendspin**: Native Music Assistant player using synchronized audio protocol
    - **Snapcast**: Synchronized multiroom audio client for Snapserver

    ## Audio Devices
    The API automatically detects available audio devices:
    - **Hardware devices**: `hw:X,Y` format (e.g., `hw:1,0`)
    - **Virtual devices**: `null`, `pulse`, `dmix`, `default`
    - **USB devices**: Automatically detected with proper mixer controls
    - **PulseAudio**: Automatic switching when running in HAOS

    ## Volume Control
    Volume control uses ALSA mixer with automatic control detection:
    - Tries multiple mixer controls: `Master`, `PCM`, `Speaker`, `Headphone`, `Digital`
    - Returns specific control used in success messages
    - Supports 0-100% volume range

        For hardware devices, this uses ALSA mixer controls (`amixer`).
        The system automatically tries multiple mixer controls:
        - `Master` (most common)
        - `PCM` (common for USB devices) 
        - `Speaker` 
        - `Headphone`
        - `Digital`
        
        The response indicates which control was successfully used.

        Get information about player state persistence.

        **Note:** This endpoint is only available when running `app_enhanced.py`.
        The enhanced app provides automatic state persistence, saving player
        running states to `player_states.yaml` and restoring them on startup.

        This is useful for:
        - Checking if state persistence is active
        - Monitoring how many players are running vs configured
        - Verifying the state file exists

        **Note:** This endpoint is only available when running `app_enhanced.py`.

        The enhanced app automatically saves state periodically (every 30 seconds
        by default) and when players are started/stopped. This endpoint allows
        forcing an immediate save, which can be useful:
        - Before shutting down the container
        - After batch configuration changes
        - For backup purposes

        The state is saved to `player_states.yaml` in the config directory.
