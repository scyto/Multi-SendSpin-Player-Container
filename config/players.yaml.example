# Example Player Configuration
# This file shows the structure of a typical players.yaml configuration file
# The actual file will be generated automatically when you create players through the web interface

# Example configuration with two Sendspin players:

Kitchen:
  name: Kitchen
  clientId: "a1b2c3d4e5f6"    # Auto-generated unique ID
  deviceId: "0"               # PortAudio device index
  serverUrl: ""               # Empty for auto-discovery
  delayMs: 0                  # Audio delay offset in milliseconds
  logLevel: INFO
  codec: opus
  bufferSizeMs: 100
  volume: 75
  isMuted: false

Bedroom:
  name: Bedroom
  clientId: "f6e5d4c3b2a1"
  deviceId: "1"
  serverUrl: ""
  delayMs: 50                 # Positive delay if this room is ahead
  logLevel: INFO
  codec: opus
  bufferSizeMs: 100
  volume: 80
  isMuted: false

# Configuration field explanations:
#
# name: Display name for the player (must be unique)
# clientId: Unique identifier for Sendspin protocol (auto-generated)
# deviceId: PortAudio device index (use web UI to see available devices)
#   - "0", "1", "2" etc. for PortAudio device indices
#   - "null" for testing without audio hardware
# serverUrl: Music Assistant server URL (empty for auto-discovery via mDNS)
# delayMs: Audio delay offset in milliseconds for multi-room sync
#   - Positive values delay audio (use if this room is ahead)
#   - Negative values advance audio (use if this room is behind)
# logLevel: Logging verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
# codec: Audio codec (opus recommended)
# bufferSizeMs: Audio buffer size in milliseconds
# volume: Default volume level (0-100)
# isMuted: Whether the player is muted

# Notes:
# - Each player needs a unique name and clientId
# - Use the web interface at http://localhost:8096 to create players
# - Device indices are shown in the web interface device dropdown
# - Players are automatically started on container restart if they were running
