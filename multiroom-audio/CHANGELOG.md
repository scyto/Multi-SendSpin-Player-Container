# Changelog

## [1.2.2] - Startup Fix

### Fixed
- **Segmentation fault on startup**: Replaced gunicorn with Flask's built-in server to avoid fork-related crashes with SocketIO and audio libraries (sounddevice/PortAudio)
- The gunicorn pre-fork model caused segfaults when native audio libraries were initialized before the fork

### Technical Details
- Flask's development server is sufficient for home automation with limited concurrent users
- Eliminates race conditions between gunicorn worker forks and SocketIO/audio initialization

## [1.1.0] - Snapcast & HAOS Support

### Added
- Snapcast player provider for synchronized multiroom audio
- Home Assistant OS add-on support with PulseAudio integration
- Environment detection module for automatic Docker/HAOS adaptation
- Host ID auto-generation for Snapcast players
- Latency compensation configuration for Snapcast

### Changed
- Audio backend automatically switches between ALSA (Docker) and PulseAudio (HAOS)
- Updated documentation for all three player backends
- Improved provider architecture with consistent interfaces

### Notes
- Squeezelite and Snapcast use ALSA devices (`hw:X,Y`) in standalone Docker
- All providers use PulseAudio when running as HAOS add-on
- Sendspin continues to use PortAudio device indices
